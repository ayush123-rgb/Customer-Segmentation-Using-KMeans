Title : Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

Author : Ayush Paigude

Dataset : The dataset consists of various columns like Customer, Gender etc. The daataset size is 201 x 5.

Description : This code performs customer segmentation using KMeans clustering on a dataset containing Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. It includes comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) using matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly to visualize distributions, relationships, and gender-based insights. The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters in 2D and 3D feature spaces, followed by applying KMeans to segment customers accordingly. Finally, the clusters are visualized interactively (3D) and statically (2D), helping identify distinct behavioral groups for targeted marketing. The result is a clear, visual, and data-driven approach to understanding customer patterns.
